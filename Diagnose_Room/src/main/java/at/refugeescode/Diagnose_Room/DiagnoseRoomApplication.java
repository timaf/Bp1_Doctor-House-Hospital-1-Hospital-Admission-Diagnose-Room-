		The Hospital Admission is an app that receives Patients through the /patients endpoint.
		 As soon as they arrive they get a patient number given and they are forwarded to the Diagnose Room.
		  The Dr House will observe the Patientâ€™s symptoms and figure out his illness ,
		  and if he is unsure, he will quickly estimate that it must be lupus. Later on,
		   after the 4 Bps are concluded, the Dr House will forward the Patient with his right diagnosis to the Nurser*/
